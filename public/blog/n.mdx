necessarily involves management but not traditional management principles that can't handle the chaos of startups

startup = "a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty"
institution - one that is greater than its parts, a whole organization more than a product or idea
product - any source of value for customers
extreme uncertainty - must dare to venture and not create clones

rapid changes, enabling experimentation and learning, quick feedback from customers

validated learning = "process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup's present and future" rather than the cold comfort of learning as an excuse after failure

IMVU -> lean thinking defines value as "providing benefit to the customer, anything else if waste"

repeated experimentation and validated learning from customers to figure out the right things to build and what customers would use

Lean Startup model is an experiment to achieve validated learning through the scientific method

do practical experiemnts to test costumer feelings instead of inaccurate surveys since costumers themselves have difficulty assessing their feelings objectively
